## Here's how I made this website using GitHub Pages:

### Step 1. Go to GitHub.
* Log into your [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

### Step 2. Make new repository.
* Name the repository username.github.io (where “username” is your GitHub user name).

### Step 3. Set your theme.
* Settings->Select a theme. This will bring up index.md.
* You can make some edits to index.md to change content at this point.
* Or just start by committing changes at the bottom of index.md.

### Step 4. Test your new website.
* You should now be able to see your site at username.github.io.
* If not maybe wait a couple of mins and try again.

### Step 5. Customise your theme.
* Theme information is contained in _config.yml. Can add to this.
* e.g.:
```markdown
title: Put in a new title here
description: Put in a new description here.
```

### Step 6. Customise your homepage
* Edit index.md
* Make use of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* e.g.:
```markdown
* Top level header: # Header 1
* 2nd level header: ## Header 2
* 3rd level header: ### Header 3
* Bold, Italic and Code text: **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
* Links: [Link](url)
* Images: ![Image](src)
```

### Step 7. Add more pages
* Create additional .md files to create extra pages
* e.g. /about/contact-us.md
